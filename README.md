# Let's move

Let's Move is an online property portal specialising in East London. Let's create a database for it.

Run the script below as your user to create the new database

```
CREATE DATABASE letsmove;
```

Create a new connection to the `letsmove` database. Using the new connection run the script below to create the new table.

```
CREATE TABLE property (
	id serial PRIMARY KEY,
	property_type varchar (20) NOT NULL,
	bedrooms numeric default 0,
	bathrooms numeric default 0,
	agent varchar (20) NOT NULL,
	location varchar (20) NOT NULL,
	price numeric NOT NULL,
	date_sold date,
	sold_price numeric
);
```

Run the scripts below to insert the data

```
INSERT INTO property
